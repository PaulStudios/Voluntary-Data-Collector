# **Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** 22-07-24

**Author:** Indradip Paul [HilFing] - PaulStudios

## **Introduction**
Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at PaulStudios ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at paulstudiosofficial@gmail.com.

When you use our mobile application, Voluntary Data Collector (the "App"), you trust us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy policy, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our App.

This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our App, and/or any related services, sales, marketing, or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy policy as the "Services").

## **Information We Collect**

### **Personal Information You Disclose to Us**
We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the App, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when you participate in activities on the App, or otherwise when you contact us.

The personal information we collect may include the following:
- **Personal Information Provided by You.** We collect email addresses, Google or GitHub authentication information, and other similar information.

### **Data Collected Through the App**
When you use the App, we may collect certain data automatically, including but not limited to:
- **Geolocation Information.** We may request access or permission to track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our App, to provide certain location-based services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.
- **Mobile Device Access.** We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device’s sensors. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.
- **Mobile Device Data.** We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, version information, and system configuration information, device and application identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model, Internet service provider, and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server) only when users contact us for resolving problems they are facing as part of system logs.

## **Data Anonymization and Security**

### **Anonymization**
All GPS data collected through the App is anonymized before it is sent to our servers. This means that personal identifiers are removed or obfuscated to ensure that the data cannot be traced back to an individual user. The anonymization process involves the generation of a unique random hash, which is treated as a user_id. Data is uploaded only with this ID, without any other identifying information such as mobile details or user details.

### **Encryption**
We use advanced encryption standards, specifically AES-256, to protect the data both in transit and at rest. Data is encrypted on the user's device before being sent to our servers via HTTPS, ensuring secure communication. Once the data reaches our servers, it remains encrypted within our database.

### **Data Cleaning**
All collected data is cleaned of personal information within the App before it is uploaded to our servers. This ensures that no personally identifiable information (PII) is stored or processed by our backend systems.

## **Use of Your Information**
We use the information we collect or receive:
- **To facilitate account creation and logon process.** If you choose to link your account with us to a third-party account (such as your Google or GitHub account), we use the information you allowed us to collect from those third parties to facilitate account creation and logon process.
- **To post testimonials and results.** We post testimonials and results derived from the anonymized data on our Services. Raw data will never be publicly disclosed.
- **Request feedback.** We may use your information to request feedback and to contact you about your use of our Services.
- **To protect our Services.** We may use your information as part of our efforts to keep our Services safe and secure (for example, for fraud monitoring and prevention).
- **To enforce our terms, conditions, and policies.**
- **To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.** If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.

## **Data Retention**
We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law. Data will generally be kept for 6 months, but may be retained for longer based on company and system needs. Data deletion can be requested by emailing us. Data older than 6 months will not be available for deletion due to it being made part of the system architecture (anonymized).

## **User Control and Rights**
- **Accessing Your Data:** Users can request to receive a list of all their data.
- **Data Deletion:** Users can request the deletion of their data. Since the data is not human-readable, editing is not possible. Users can also email us to withdraw their acceptance of this policy, which will result in the deletion of all their data.
- **Data Retrieval and Requests:** To exercise these rights, please contact us at paulstudiosofficial@gmail.com. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## **Sharing Your Information**
We only share and disclose your information in the following situations:
- **Compliance with Laws.** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
- **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
- **Business Partners.** We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions. User data will never be shared with ad services for promotions, other products, or services.

## **Data Security**
The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.

## **Use of Data for Research and Development**
The data we collect is used as training data for machine learning models developed by PaulStudios. Currently, GPS data is used for the project "UrbanFlow: Smart Traffic Light System with Dynamic Priority Management." UrbanFlow is a smart traffic light management system designed to prioritize emergency vehicles and optimize traffic flow. The system uses real-time data, machine learning, and the Google Maps API to enhance urban traffic efficiency. Statistical data about the number of active users is collected for improving our services.

## **Changes to This Privacy Policy**
This Privacy Policy is effective as of 22-07-24 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice on our App.
